This is the source code for the Uberject project.

The Uberject project aims to implement a working type system in python, for python.

It works by wrapping methods in a function controlling types before actually running the method.

Types are specified as part of the docstring.

Uberject currently targets python 2.X

The project is made for the fun of it, and to do silly things in python.
